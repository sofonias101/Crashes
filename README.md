# Crashes
**##Accident Calculator**
Write a program, that calculates a number of individual collisions that happened based on the direction of the cars in front of the office right before the
accident. All cars going left or right were going at the same speed. You can assume that a car involved in an accident stops and becomes stationary at the
moment of the collision.
Collision happens when a car in motion hits a car that is either moving in an opposite direction or is stationary. Any car that is involved in a collision
and is in motion at the time counts as one (so head collision of two cars moving against each other counts as two, while car hitting a stationary car
counts as one).
